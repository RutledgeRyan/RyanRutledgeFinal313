This Project was Created Through CRA in the Terminal,

I began with navigating to the correct folder directory that I wanted to create the application in, then use npx create-react-app and named my project.
I then navigated to the newly created project file, and typed code. to open the folder that was just created in Visual Studio Code.

We will now want to install our Tailwind CSS in the terminal:

npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
and npx init -p

Ensure that the node_modules are loaded into the project:

npm i nodemon

Install express and cors to allow the connection for our API that we have created to load data into the project:

npm i express
npm i cors

Install React-Router to allow for Domain Routing to create multiple pages within the project:

npm install react-router-dom

Now that are installs have been completed, We will want to setup our API for our Application to pull data from:

cd src
node Server.js

This will setup our API on Localhost:/5000

Now we will need to navigate back to the base folder of our project:

Create a New Terminal, leaving the API Terminal Open and In Use.

Now that we are back to the main page, we can begin with our startup and launch the homepage:

npm start

Now we will have our multipage react application loading up on localhost:/2000

From This point forward Navigate through the pages and components as needed!
